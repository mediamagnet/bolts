## Congratulations!
You have successfully created a basic DisGord bot.

In order for your bot to start you must supply a environment variable with the name DISGORD_TOKEN that holds
the bot token you created in a Discord application or got from a friend.
See tutorial here to find/create the token: https://github.com/andersfylling/disgord/wiki/Get-bot-token-and-add-it-to-a-server

eg. \"export DISGORD_TOKEN=si7fisdgfsfushgsjdf.sdfksgjyefs.dfgysyefs\"

A dockerfile has also been created to build a proper production image. Note that you must supply the environment variable DISGORD_TOKEN when running the container.
